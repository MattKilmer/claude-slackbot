### Step 2: Set Up Slack App

#### A. Create Slack App

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click **"Create New App"** → **"From scratch"**
3. Name it: `Claude AutoFix Bot`
4. Select your workspace

#### B. Configure Bot Token Scopes

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Bot Token Scopes**
3. Add these scopes:
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`
   - `reactions:write`
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`

4. Click **"Install to Workspace"**
5. **Copy the Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
6. Paste it into your `.env.local` as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

#### C. Get Signing Secret

1. Go to **Basic Information**
2. Scroll to **App Credentials**
3. **Copy the Signing Secret**
4. Paste it into `.env.local` as `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`

#### D. Get Channel ID

1. Open Slack (desktop or web)
2. Right-click on the channel you want to monitor
3. Select **"View channel details"**
4. Scroll down and copy the **Channel ID** (starts with `C`)
5. Paste it into `.env.local` as `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`

---

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `Claude AutoFix Bot`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (all repo permissions)
   - ✅ `workflow`
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_`)
7. Paste it into `.env.local` as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

---

### Step 4: Test Locally

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
Vercel CLI 39.x.x
> Ready! Available at http://localhost:3000
```

In another terminal, test the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

You should see JSON with `"status": "healthy"` ✅

---

### Step 5: Expose Webhook with ngrok

Since we're testing locally, we need to expose the webhook to Slack:

```bash
# Install ngrok if you don't have it
brew install ngrok

# Or download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000
```

You'll see:
```
Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

**Copy the HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

---

### Step 6: Configure Slack Event Subscriptions

1. Go back to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Select your app
3. Go to **Event Subscriptions**
4. Toggle **Enable Events** to **ON**
5. Set **Request URL** to:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/slack-events
   ```
   (Replace `abc123` with your ngrok subdomain)

6. Wait for the green **"Verified ✓"** checkmark

7. Scroll to **Subscribe to bot events**
8. Click **"Add Bot User Event"**
9. Add: `message.channels`

10. Click **"Save Changes"**

---

### Step 7: Add Claude API Key

Paste your Claude API key into `.env.local`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-key-here
```

---

### Step 8: Test End-to-End! 🎉

1. Go to your Slack channel
2. Post a message like:

```
Fix the bug in the header component where the logo doesn't display on mobile
```

3. Watch the magic happen:
   - Bot reacts with 👀
   - Posts status updates
   - Claude analyzes the code
   - Creates a new branch
   - Commits the fix
   - Creates a Pull Request
   - Deploys preview (if Vercel configured)
   - Posts final results with PR link! ✅

## 📊 Expected Slack Updates

You'll see the message update through these stages:

1. `🔧 Analyzing issue...`
2. `📦 Cloning repository...`
3. `🤖 Running Claude Agent...`
4. `💾 Creating branch...`
5. `💾 Committing changes...`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Slack signature"
- Make sure `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is correct
- Restart `npm run dev` after changing `.env.local`
- Restart ngrok

### "Claude API error"
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is correct (starts with `sk-ant-`)
- Check you have API credits available

### "Git push failed"
- Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `repo` scope
- Make sure token isn't expired
- Check repository permissions

### "Deployment not found"
- Vercel integration is optional for MVP
- The bot will still create the PR successfully
- You can manually deploy or check Vercel later

### Webhook not receiving events
- Check ngrok is still running
- Verify Slack Event Subscriptions URL is correct
- Look at Vercel dev logs for errors

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Production

Once everything works locally:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

Then:
1. Update Slack Event Subscriptions URL to production URL:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/slack-events
   ```

2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.local`

3. Test in production!

```
Fix the bug where the submit button doesn't work on the contact form
```

### Feature Request
```
Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page
```
